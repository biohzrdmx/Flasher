Flasher
=======

Some Rails-like `flash[]` functionality for Hummingbird Lite.

Pass simple strings between requests, useful for web applications and MVC-style implementations.

## Requirements

- Hummingbird Lite 3.0.1 or newer

## Usage

First, include the library.

Then, to set a value call the `flash` method:

	Flasher::flash('message', 'Hi!');

The values will be held on `$_SESSION` until the next request, then you can recover them:

	$message = Flasher::flash('message');

If you want to keep an entry for another request, use the `keep` method:

	Flasher::keep('message');

Flasher includes two utility methods `alert` and `notice`:

	Flasher::alert('The password is not valid');
	Flasher::notice('You settings have been updated');

To recover them:

	$alert = Flasher::alert();
	$notice = Flasher::notice();
